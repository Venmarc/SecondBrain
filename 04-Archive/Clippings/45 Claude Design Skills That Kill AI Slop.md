AI design all looks the same. These 45 skills fix it. Most install in 1 command.

Every vibe coded site has the same tell: a purple to white gradient, Inter font, 4 cards in a grid, 1 weak hover state. The model ships the median, and the median is dead.

Skills are SKILL.md files plain markdown rules that load into Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex and overwrite the model's default taste before a single line of CSS gets written. Below are 45 of them across 6 layers: frontend UI, image/3D/video, the Claude Design product, and 3 layers of AI-product design pulled from a 42-skill open repo.

Each entry: what it gives, the install line, the prompt or code to fire it, and the payoff.

Quick map of the 3 install methods you'll see:

```text
# Method 1 — universal SKILL.md installer (works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI)
npx skills add <github-repo> --skill <skill-name>

# Method 2 — Claude Code plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add <owner/repo>
/plugin install <name>@<marketplace>

# Method 3 — MCP server (for tools like Figma, Blender, Playwright)
claude mcp add <name> -- npx <package>
```

## Layer 1 — Frontend & UI (the anti-slop core)

**1\. frontend design Anthropic**

The floor. The skill everyone agrees on. 277,000+ installs as of March 2026.

```text
npx skills add https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill --skill design-taste-frontend
```

```text
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
/plugin install frontend-design
# or universal:
npx skills add anthropics/skills --skill frontend-design
```

Fire it by just asking for UI it auto-triggers:

```text
Build a landing page for an AI security startup. Pick a bold aesthetic direction and commit to it.
```

What you get: before writing CSS, Claude must answer 4 questions purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation and pick 1 extreme (brutalist, editorial, retro-futuristic, luxury, maximalist). It bans Inter, Roboto, Arial, and Space Grotesk. Output is production HTML/CSS/JS or React with real type pairings, not the default slop.

**2\. impeccable Paul Bakaus (creator of jQuery UI)**

35,800+ GitHub stars in days. 1 skill, 23 commands, 44 deterministic anti pattern rules.

```text
npx impeccable install
# then inside your agent:
/impeccable init
```

Use single word commands instead of paragraphs:

```text
/impeccable polish     # full quality pass on the selected component
/impeccable critique   # scores your UI out of 40 and lists the slop
typeset · colorize · bolder · quieter · delight · animate · layout
```

What you get: runs in 2 modes brand (marketing, editorial) and product (dashboards, internal tools) because a landing page and an admin panel need opposite things. Enforces a 4px/8px spacing grid, OKLCH color, clamp() fluid type, WCAG AA contrast. The same prompt that produced chaos now reads like senior work.

**3\. taste-skill (design-taste-frontend) Leonxlnx**

102,800+ installs, 31,700+ stars. The "give my AI good taste" skill.

```text
npx skills add https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill --skill design-taste-frontend
```

It runs on 3 dials you can override in chat:

```text
Build a portfolio. VARIANCE 9, MOTION 7, DENSITY 3.
# VARIANCE = how asymmetric · MOTION = how kinetic · DENSITY = info per screen
```

What you get: ships opinionated defaults (Next.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Radix) so you never start from a blank slate. Default 8/6/4 leans artsy and kinetic. It stops asking permission and just applies taste asymmetric layouts, real motion, GSAP skeletons, a hard em-dash ban.

**4\. emil-design-eng / animate Emil Kowalski**

The motion brain. Distilled from the animations course into hard rules.

```text
npx skills add https://github.com/delphi-ai/animate-skill --skill animate
```

```text
Add a polished enter/exit animation to this modal. Use the emil rules.
```

What you get: micro interactions 150-250ms, standard transitions 200-350ms, exits faster than entrances (300ms in, 200ms out), staggers 30-60ms, never animate over 1 second, ease out for entrances, only animate transform and opacity for 60fps, always honor prefers-reduced-motion. Janky UI becomes smooth.

**5\. design-motion-principles kylezantos**

A motion auditor with 3 conflicting lenses, weighted to your project.

```text
npx skills add kylezantos/design-motion-principles
```

```text
Audit the animations in this dashboard and fix the worst offenders.
```

What you get: blends Emil Kowalski (restraint), Jakub Krehel (production polish), and Jhey Tompkins (playful) weighted by context. Catches scale(0) starts, bare ease, decorative by default motion, missing reduced-motion. 2 modes: create or audit.

**6\. theme factory Composio (awesome-codex-skills)**

Stops the agent inventing a one off hex value for every component.

```text
/plugin marketplace add ComposioHQ/awesome-codex-skills
```

```text
Generate a token system: light, dark, and high-contrast from this 1 brand color.
```

What you get: reusable theme tokens colors, spacing scales, type ramps as CSS variables with consistent naming. A real system instead of a mood board.

**7\. figma implement design OpenAI/Anthropic Figma bridge**

For when the Figma file exists and you want faithful translation, not riffing.

```text
# Claude Code via Figma MCP:
claude mcp add figma -- npx figma-developer-mcp --stdio
```

```text
Implement this Figma frame in React. Handle hover, selected, empty, and loading states.
```

What you get: translates Figma into production code that respects your existing design system, generates multiple states per design in 1 pass, and pairs with Playwright to verify fidelity across viewports. Closes the gap between designed and shipped.

**8\. webapp-testing / playwright the visual feedback loop**

The single highest-leverage thing you can hand a design agent: eyes.

```text
claude mcp add playwright -s user -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

```text
Open the app in a headless browser, screenshot every page at 1920 and 390 wide, then compare to my reference and fix the gaps.
```

What you get: Claude opens a real browser, screenshots each page, compares against targets across viewports, and iterates layout until it matches. Without it you're trusting a blind model. With it, the model grades itself.

**9\. brandkit Leonxlnx (taste-skill repo)**

One shot brand identity boards.

```text
npx skills add https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill --skill brandkit
```

```text
Generate a brand board for a cold-brew coffee startup: logo concepts, color system, type, 3 mockups.
```

What you get: full identity boards logo directions, palette, typography, category mockups as reference frames you then hand to Claude Code for real code.

**10\. designer skills collection Owl Listener**

63 skills + 27 commands across 8 plugins: research, systems, strategy, UI, interaction, prototyping, design ops, toolkit.

```text
/plugin marketplace add Owl-Listener/designer-skills
```

```text
/discover     # runs a full research discovery cycle
/strategize   # builds UX strategy from vision to metrics
/handoff      # dev handoff package: measurements, behaviors, edge cases, QA
```

What you get: the unglamorous process work juniors skip handoff specs, design rationale, QA checklists. Strong on process, weaker on taste, so pair it with #1-#3.

## Layer 2 — Image, Graphics, 3D & Video

**11\. nano banana Gemini image generation inside the terminal**

Generate blog headers, thumbnails, mockups, and room redesigns without leaving Claude. ~$0.04 per image.

```text
/plugin marketplace add devonjones/devon-claude-skills
/plugin install nano-banana@devon-claude-skills
# needs a free Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
```

```text
/banana redesign this room like a professional interior designer — keep the windows, swap the furniture to mid-century, warmer light
```

What you get: text to image, editing, and multi turn refinement through Gemini 3 Pro Image. Upload a photo of your room and get clean, usable redesigns; swap furniture, colors, and layout by chatting. Same trick works for thumbnails and product shots.

**12\. banana claude Claude as Creative Director**

A smarter wrapper: Claude interprets intent, picks domain expertise, and builds the prompt for you.

```text
/plugin marketplace add AgriciDaniel/banana-claude
/plugin install banana-claude@banana-claude-marketplace
```

```text
/banana generate "a hero image for a coffee shop website"
/banana inspire   # browse a 2,500+ prompt database
```

What you get: Claude applies Google's 5 component formula Subject, Action, Location, Composition, Style so a lazy 1 line request becomes a directed shot. 13 modes including style transfer, inpainting, and 4K.

**13\. canvas-design social graphics as real files**

Turns Claude into a graphic designer that outputs actual PNG and PDF, not flat JPEGs.

```text
npx skills add anthropics/skills --skill canvas-design
```

```text
Make an Instagram carousel: 6 slides, my brand colors, 1 stat per slide, export as PNG.
```

What you get: real, editable social graphics carousels, quote cards, infographics built in code so fonts, colors, and logos stay correct. Exports as PNG/PDF you can ship.

**14\. algorithmic art generative art**

For backgrounds, hero textures, and abstract visuals built from math, not stock.

```text
npx skills add anthropics/skills --skill algorithmic-art
```

```text
Generate an animated SVG background: flow field, 2 brand colors, subtle, 60fps.
```

What you get: code driven generative pieces flow fields, noise, particles that are unique per render and never look like a stock asset.

**15\. remotion superpowers a full video studio in Claude Code**

13 commands, 5 MCP servers. The skill that hit 13M views in 1 week.

```text
/plugin marketplace add DojoCodingLabs/remotion-superpowers
/plugin install remotion-superpowers@remotion-superpowers
/setup
```

```text
Make a 30-second product launch video: logo animation, 3 feature callouts, TikTok captions, CTA at the end.
```

What you get: AI voiceovers, music, stock footage, image/video generation, TikTok style captions, scene transitions, and a render → review → fix loop. Claude writes React components, Remotion renders to MP4. No timeline editor.

**16\. claude remotion kickstart / Remotion Skills motion graphics from a prompt**

The official, lighter entry point to programmatic video.

```text
npx create-video@latest
# choose Blank template, yes to TailwindCSS, yes to install Skills
```

```text
Create a data-viz explainer: animate revenue from $0 to $40,000 over 5 seconds, count-up effect.
```

What you get: describe the video in English, Claude writes the TypeScript, Remotion renders frame by frame. Pre built title slides, code blocks, captions, and transitions. Best for explainers, demos, and short-form social.

**17\. blender motion 3D scenes via Blender MCP**

Drive Blender with text. Objects, materials, lighting, cameras all from prompts.

```text
# Install the Blender MCP add-on from projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp
# In Blender: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install > Enable > Start MCP Server
npx skills add LobzyJay/motion-design-with-claude --skill blender-motion
```

```text
Build a slow 360 turntable of a glass perfume bottle, studio 3-point lighting, render at 1080p.
```

What you get: Claude writes the bpy Python keyframes, F-curve modifiers, drivers, geometry nodes, render setup so you direct and the AI handles the scene graph. Free plugin, no 3D skills required.

**18\. aftereffects motion After Effects via MCP**

Live commands into AE plus a JSX scripting bridge.

```text
# Install the After Effects MCP (TheLlamainator/after-effects-mcp)
npx skills add LobzyJay/motion-design-with-claude --skill aftereffects-motion
```

```text
Animate this logo: scale in with overshoot, 0.4s, then a subtle shimmer sweep.
```

What you get: 2 modes live MCP commands or generated JSX scripts with ExtendScript patterns, expressions, and an effects catalog. Loads automatically when AE is the subject.

## Layer 3 — Claude Design (the product at claude ai/design)

Web only for now, paid Claude plan required. 2 panes: chat on the left, a live design canvas on the right. Unlike flat JPEG image generators, everything is built in code so fonts, colors, and logos stay editable and usable. These 4 "skills" are really the 4 ways to drive it.

**19\. High fidelity web & app mockups**

```text
On the canvas: design a SaaS pricing page, 3 tiers, my design system, ready-to-build fidelity.
```

What you get: finished web or app screens you can iterate element by element by chat something code only workflows could never do. Best for infographics, mockups, carousels, and decks where design = graphics + shapes + type + your images.

**20\. Design systems (train it on your brand)**

```text
Create a design system: my logo, header font, body font, and these 4 brand colors.
```

What you get: a reusable style guide the canvas applies to everything. Hold several, switch between them per project. The product barely works without this feed it structure first.

**21\. Templates (lock the structure)**

```text
Turn this finished Instagram carousel into a template I can reuse every week.
```

What you get: build 1 perfect version, save it as a template, then pair it with any design system. Output looks the same and looks good every single time the core trick for repeatable content.

**22\. Slide decks**

```text
Build a 10-slide pitch deck from this outline, using my deck template and brand colors.
```

What you get: presentations from a template, exportable. Two of the biggest work pain points web design and slides are exactly what this product targets. Export to Canva or hand off to Claude Code to ship as a real site.

23\. Composio MCP connect 1,000+ apps

Wire Claude to Figma, Slides, GitHub, and 1,000+ others so design work flows into your real tools.

```text
claude mcp add composio -- npx @composio/mcp@latest
```

```text
Pull the latest frame from my Figma file, implement it, and open a PR on GitHub.
```

What you get: the connective layer. Claude reads a Figma design, writes the code, commits to GitHub, and updates Slides without you leaving the chat.

## Layer 4 — AI Product Interaction Design

The next 22 are conceptual SKILL.md files from an open 42-skill repo (Owl-Listener/ai-design-skills, MIT). They don't draw pixels they make Claude design the behavior of AI products. Install pattern for all of them:

```text
npx skills add https://github.com/Owl-Listener/ai-design-skills --skill <name>
```

**24\. context window design**

```text
Design a token budget for this support agent: system prompt, history, retrieval, tool results.
```

What you get: treats the context window as a design material. Allocates token budgets, picks summarization vs retrieval, orders by priority (recency bias), and specifies graceful degradation when the window fills instead of hallucinated continuity.

**25\. conversation patterns**

```text
Design the turn-taking and repair flow for a booking assistant.
```

What you get: deliberate turn length, who speaks first, repair sequences (self-repair, clarification, graceful misunderstanding), and grounding checkpoints so the bot recovers from breakdowns instead of improvising.

**26\. generative ui**

```text
Design a chat where the AI renders dynamic UI components — date pickers, cards, charts — based on the answer.
```

What you get: rules for when the model should generate interface elements vs plain text, how to keep them consistent, and how to fall back safely. Output reads as a product, not a wall of text.

**27\. progressive disclosure**

```text
Design onboarding that reveals this AI's power gradually to match a new user's mental model.
```

What you get: a staged reveal of capability so users aren't overwhelmed on turn 1 and don't underuse the tool by turn 50. Maps features to user readiness.

**28\. multimodal orchestration**

```text
Coordinate text, image, and tool-use in 1 flow for a recipe assistant that reads a fridge photo.
```

What you get: a plan for sequencing modalities when to look, when to call a tool, when to speak so a single interaction blends vision, text, and actions cleanly.

**29\. mixed initiative flow**

```text
Define when this agent leads vs when the user leads, and how control hands off.
```

What you get: explicit rules for initiative AI led for guided workflows, user led for exploration and clean handoff signals, so neither side stalls waiting for the other.

**30\. frustration detection**

```text
Read user frustration from text signals and adapt this support bot before they rage-quit.
```

What you get: detection from caps, punctuation density, repetition, and latency plus an adaptation playbook (simplify, slow down, offer a human) that fires before the user disengages.

**31\. feedback loops**

```text
Design correction and rating mechanisms for this writing assistant.
```

What you get: ambient signals first (edits, regenerations, abandonment), explicit ratings sparingly, inline editing and partial acceptance, and a feedback to adaptation map so corrections actually change behavior.

## Layer 5 — System Behavior & Prompt Architecture

**32\. system prompt structure**

```text
Audit and rebuild this system prompt with labeled sections.
```

What you get: a clean anatomy identity, context, behavioral rules, output spec, examples with the important instructions first and last (where the model attends most). Kills kitchen-sink and contradictory prompts.

**33\. persona architecture**

```text
Define the character, voice, and 3 personality traits for a fintech assistant.
```

What you get: a consistent AI character traits, voice, boundaries specified once so behavior holds across sessions and edge cases instead of drifting per reply.

**34\. tone calibration**

```text
Map tone settings: formal for legal answers, warm for onboarding, terse for power users.
```

What you get: per context dials for formality, warmth, confidence, and style so the same model sounds right in a crisis ticket and a welcome flow.

**35\. emotional design**

```text
Define how this AI responds to user frustration, confusion, delight, and distress.
```

What you get: a response map for each emotional state validate without amplifying, de escalate, hand off when needed so the product feels human at the moments that matter.

**36\. template design**

```text
Build a reusable, parameterized prompt template for product-description generation.
```

What you get: prompts with named, typed, bounded variables ({user\_query}, not {input1}), conditional sections, and defaults consistent outputs at scale with 1 maintainable source.

**37\. few shot patterns**

```text
Write 3 examples that steer this classifier toward the edge cases it keeps missing.
```

What you get: example sets that target failure modes, not happy paths input/output pairs and tricky cases that move behavior more than 10 lines of instruction ever will.

**38\. chain of thought design**

```text
Design the reasoning steps this agent should take before it answers a refund question.
```

What you get: deliberate reasoning chains that improve accuracy on multi step tasks, with the thinking structured rather than left to the model to improvise.

**39\. constraint specification**

```text
Lock output format, max length, tone, and forbidden content for this summarizer.
```

What you get: testable boundaries format, length, tone, content limits written so you can actually verify the model followed them. If you can't tell, the rule gets rewritten.

## Layer 6 — Trust, Evaluation & Agent Orchestration

**40\. guardrail design**

```text
Define what this agent must never do, and how it refuses.
```

What you get: explicit behavioral boundaries and refusal patterns the do's and don'ts as enforceable lines, not vibes.

**41\. trust calibration**

```text
Design confidence and source signals so users neither overtrust nor undertrust this answer.
```

What you get: deliberate confidence and citation signaling that helps users form warranted trust flagging uncertainty instead of bluffing, and showing sources where it counts.

**42\. transparency patterns**

```text
Show users what this AI knows, doesn't know, and how sure it is.
```

What you get: patterns for surfacing the model's knowledge edges and confidence so users can calibrate their own reliance instead of guessing.

**43\. output quality rubrics**

```text
Write a rubric for "good" output: accuracy, relevance, helpfulness, with pass/fail per dimension.
```

What you get: a concrete definition of quality you can grade against the thing that turns "looks fine" into a measurable bar and powers regression testing.

**44\. task decomposition + agent role design**

```text
Break this goal into subtasks and define what each agent owns, knows, and does.
```

What you get: complex goals split into agent-sized subtasks, each agent with a clear role and boundary the backbone of a multi agent system that doesn't collide with itself.

**45\. handoff protocols**

```text
Design the handoff between the research agent, the writer agent, and the human reviewer.
```

What you get: smooth transitions between agents and between AI and humans what context passes, what gets confirmed, where a person reviews so work doesn't drop on the seams.

## How to actually use this

Don't install 45 at once. Stack 3-4 that fight slop at the source, then add eyes:

1. **frontend design** or **impeccable** or **taste skill** — pick 1 as your base taste layer
2. **emil design eng** — motion that doesn't feel cheap
3. **theme factory** — 1 token system, no one-off hex values
4. **playwright** — the feedback loop, so the model grades its own work

Same tool. Completely different output.

Skills set the aesthetic floor. Taste still comes from understanding the constraints not from a blocklist of banned fonts. The skills get you to senior looking. The judgment about which direction to commit to is still yours.
